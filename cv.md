## About me
I am a beginner Frontend Developer. I've been learning frontend since Spring 2022 and I really want to become a professional developer.  I have great ideas for creating useful and unique applications, and it motivates me to develop my skills. As soon as I realize that I have a suitable skill level, I will be able to bring my ideas to life. Now I'm ready for a long marathon to learn programming and it's my lifestyle now. In my successful study I am facilitated by a good level of English, a love of data structuring, high motivation and friends-developers, from whom I can always ask for advice.
